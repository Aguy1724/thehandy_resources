## Playback Engines

*NOTE* Scripts are required for these. Local copies of the videos are also required.
See the [Scripts](#Scripts) section below
(Not to be confused with Video Platform & Syncs section above)
- [Handy Feeling: Local Video](https://www.handyfeeling.com/local-video)
  - Supports VR
- [Funscript.io: Play Mode](https://funscript.io/play)
- [Handy Feeling: Playlist Creator](https://playground.handyfeeling.com/playlist/index.html)

## Scripts

Sites that offer no playback, just the Funscripts
(Goes hand-in-hand with the Playback Engines section above)
- [EroScripts](https://discuss.eroscripts.com/)
  - Registration required, offers both free and paid scripts. Registration is free. Lots of additional information and potentially other resources.
- [ScriptAxis](https://scriptaxis.com/)
  - Personally, I haven't used this one as much, more thoughts when I do.

- [RealSync](https://realsync.us/)
  - Offers [free](https://realsync.us/collections/free-syncs) and paid Funscripts. Once again, personally I have not used this one as much.

- [Connect My Handy](https://www.connectmyhandy.com/)
  - Features popular previews for scenes released in 2010s. If available, full versions are linked inside the preview.
  - I haven't heard of this one, on my list to check out.

## Tools
- [Handy Feeling: Script Convertor](https://playground.handyfeeling.com/scriptconverter/index.html)
  - Used to convert scripts that are too long to handy, I'm not sure how often this is needed now.
- [Handy Feeling: Convert Funscript to CSV](https://www.handyfeeling.com/convert-script)

- [Funscript Conversion Tool](https://xqueezeme.github.io/)
  - Can invert Funscripts, smooth out patterns, etc.

## Development Area

- [XToys](https://xtoys.app/)
  - XToys can be extremely technical and covers a whole range of plugins and extensions for multiple sex toys. You can find user-made content on here, however I see it fitting more into a “Miscellaneous” or “Development Area” section.

- [Handy Feeling: Scripter](https://playground.handyfeeling.com/scripter3/)
  - Make your own Funscripts (with motion tracking capabilities)

- [Handy Feeling: Beatbox](https://playground.handyfeeling.com/beatboxv2/index.html)
  - Draw patterns that will be played
